## Description

The **Organ Donation Process Ontology (ODPO)** is a semantic framework designed to formally represent the organ donation workflow within the Italian National Health System context.
Conceived as an open and extensible knowledge base, ODPO is intended as a dynamic tool for educational, professional and informative purposes. It enables the simulation of clinical scenarios, making it a resource for training medical personnel and enhancing public transparency regarding the safety and rigor of the organ donation and transplantation process. Its modular structure allows for continuous updates in response to evolving medical standards and legal regulations.

## Features

- **Formal Representation**: Comprehensive OWL 2 ontology modeling the organ donation process
- **Graphical Representation**: Graphical visualization intended for better clarity and educational/informational purposes
- **Italian Healthcare Context**: Aligned with CNT (Centro Nazionale Trapianti) guidelines and regulations
- **Educational Focus**: Designed to support information dissemination and training activities
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular structure allowing for continuous updates and extensions
